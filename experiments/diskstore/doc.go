// Package diskstore provides disk-backed storage implementations for informer caches.
// The implementation is divided into two packages:
//   - engine: A core database engine with a WAL, self-describing 4 KiB block heap file,
//     fixed-size direct I/O buffer pool, out-of-place buddy allocation, crash recovery,
//     and payload encryption. See experiments/diskstore/engine/design.md for design details.
//   - kubecache: A Kubernetes cache adapter that implements client-go's cache.Indexer
//     on top of the engine with a fail-fast error policy.
